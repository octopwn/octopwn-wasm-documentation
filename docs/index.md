**Current Octopwn version:** v2.1  (6-April 2025)  
**Current closed beta:** Octopwn Binary v0.1 (6-April 2025)  
**Currently in development:** Improved automations, tutorials, more attacks and scanners
  
## Release notes for v2.1:
  
**New scanners:**  
- SSHLOGIN: Checks if user can login  
- MSSQLLOGIN: Checks if user can login  
- FTPLOGIN: Checks if user can login  
- MSSQLFINGER: Gets basic NTLM information  
- MSSQLPIPE: It's actually an SMB scanner that checks if servers expose MSSQL pipes  
- MSSQLQUERY: Performs MSSQL query on multiple targets  
- HTTPHEADER: Fetches HTTP(S) headers from targets  
  
**New clients:**  
- MSSQL  
- FTP  
  
**Added new snaffler utility:**  
- besides the core snaffler feature this module can use LLMs via ollama to automatically parse and create new credentials found during a snaffling run  
  
**Added Octopwn core callbacks:**
- target creation callback  
- credential creation callback  
- port creation callbacks  
- session creation callbacks  
These callbacks can be used to automate octopwn via already existing or user-defined modules.
  
**Added autoscan utility:**  
- automatically use built-in (or custom) scanner modules against newlty created targets and/or newly discovered ports which match the pre-set triggerport of any scanner.  
  
**Target ports are now merged when an existing target is added with ports which have not seen before**  
  
**Improved remote control modules**
  
**Changing session file password now automatically performs a save immediately to actualize the password change on disk.**  
  
**Improved plugin system:**  
- The plugin system received some improvements, and we're providing "header" files for octopwn which can be used in vscode/visual studio to help plugin developement.  
  
**Bug fixes:**  
- UI bug fixed: the starter modal's start button could be pressed mutiple times which caused multiple octopwn instances to start in paralel. Now it's been fixed.  
  
**Pyodide upgrade:**  
- We moved from Pyodide version 0.24 to 0.27. This change means considerable speed improrovements and fixes many stability issues.
