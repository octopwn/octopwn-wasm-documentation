### Security Practices

For users utilizing the live system on [live.octopwn.com](https://live.octopwn.com):

1. Establish a certificate for the WSNET proxy.

!!! warning
	IMPORTANT: *If you loaded the live version of OctoPwn via ***https***, you can only connect to wsnet proxy over secure TLS connection, unless it's listening on localhost. But even in the latter case, you MUST use ws://localhost:port, not the IP.*

If you are operating OctoPwn from your system:

- Do not forget to remove the session file upon completion of use.

And if you’ve downloaded the private key and certificates for your license, ensure:

- Secure storage, akin to how you would manage a license file.
- Never share these credentials.

!!! warning
    IMPORTANT: *If you are using Octopwn on a third party system, please make sure after you have finished working on that system to fully remove Octopwn from all computer devices on that system including temporary storages (e.g. browser cache) as per our EULA.*

### User Management

If you have purchased multiple licenses, you can assign one unassigned license to a user by inviting them from your account page on our [website](https://octopwn.com/account/login).

1. Click on the chosen license on the "Assign license user" button you want to assign.
2. Enter the email address of the invited person.
3. The invited person will get an email shortly where they can set up an account and the license will get assigned and can be used immediately.

Please note: 
- License validity starts for the date of purchase and not the date of assignment.
- License owners can be changed in the same way every 30 days in case a colleague leaves or do not with to use the license anymore.
