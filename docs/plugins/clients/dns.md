# DNS Client 
Simple DNS client based on [unidns](https://github.com/skelsec/unidns). Only TCP is supported currently! The DNS client is integrated into other functionalities within OctoPwn. In order to set a custom DNS resolver (other than the default provided by wsnet), you need to create a DNS session and set it as a default resolver for all future targets.
# Getting started

- To create the DNS client, add the DNS server as target and create the client with the DNS server selected as target. You don't need to provide any credentials. 
- In order to use the custom DNS client to automatically resolve IP addresses within OctoPwn you need to go to Global Settings > Set Resolver and enter the session id of your DNS client there.
